## Overview

As with any form of food preparation, one of the key risks of pizza is that the staff preparing your food have not cleaned their work surfaces sufficiently, or that your as the consumer have not cleaned your hands. 

## Description

Food poisoning is no joke, even to those who are used to dodgy kebabs on a night out. This risk can cause the hazard of fatigue and losing days to the porcelain telephone rather than more productive duties.

## How to Prevent

* Wash your hands sufficiently with soap or hand wash
* Ensure that all food preparation surfaces are cleaned thoroughly before use with food safe surface cleaner
* Food is cooker thoroughly and should be piping hot
* Ingredients are washed before use
